# Python images may lag behind their Debian base images. Try to avoid building an image
# with CVEs that are already fixed in stable.

# debsecan requires Python3.9. To avoid possible issues with having both the system
# Python and a Python in /usr/local, we do this in a separate stage.
#Â TODO: having to do apt-get update twice wastes time. Can we do this in a
# single RUN if we just apt-get purge -y --auto-remove desecan at the end?
# TODO: this could actually be another script, updates.sh? Might make CI easier (can
# detect if there are any upgrades to install)?
